That day, all your friends spoke to me, yet you stayed silent. Everyone waved goodbye to me… except you.
But just when I thought you wouldn’t, after you got into the bus, one hand slowly reached out of the window and waved at me. That moment is etched in my heart forever. I will never forget that day — the day a simple glance turned into a beautiful memory.')">

But the way you spoke to me, the way you treated me, touched something special deep inside my heart. You shared everything with me without hesitation, and that made me feel so comfortable that I could share each and every thing with you too.
One of my most memorable days was when you came to meet me at the bus stand while I was waiting for my bus. That was the first time we met after we had grown close. You were wearing a yellow dress, and I swear, I will never forget that day. It wasn’t just a meeting — it was a moment that stayed with me forever.')">

Even over the smallest things, we argue endlessly. And yet, strangely, I love those fights, because no matter what happens, we never let go of each other. That’s what makes us us.
Sometimes I tell myself I don’t want to talk to you anymore, but after a while I just can’t hold that feeling. Something pulls me back to you every single time. I truly believe we share a special bond — one that I hope stays with us forever. Yes, we fight a lot… but maybe that’s just another way our hearts refuse to stay apart.')">

You never get bored of talking with me, and that means more than you know.
I may not be the most interesting person in the world, but you never forget to call me, never forget to check on me, and never make me feel unimportant. Thank you for everything — for your time, your care, your patience, and most of all, for being you.')">
